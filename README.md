## Server side requirement

* Python 3.7 or higher. Older support available.[^1]
* Basic knowledge about Python
* `send2trash`, `natsort` python modules

[^1]: [<=3.4 compatibility] is on the way.

## Installation

  1. **Install Python 3.7 or higher**
  1. **Close older pyrobox process if already running**
  1. Install using PIP

### On Windows

  1. Open `CMD` or `PowerShell`
  1. Run `pip install -U pyrobox`
  1. Run `pyrobox` to launch the server on the Terminal Current Working Directory.

### On Linux

  1. Open `Terminal`
  1. Run `pip3 install -U pyrobox`
  1. Run `pyrobox` to launch the server on the Terminal Current Working Directory.

### CHECK [FAQ](#faq) FOR FUTURE HELP AND ISSUE FIX

## Customization

1. Simply running the code on will create a server on `CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY` on `Port: 6969`
1. On browser (on device under same router/wifi network), go to `deviceIP:port_number` to see the output like this: `http://192.168.0.101:6969/`
    * you must allow python in firewall to access network, check [FAQ](#faq) for more help
1. To change the server running directory,
    * (i) either edit the code  (see `config` class at top)
    * (ii) or add `-d` or `--directory` command line argument when launching the program
        * `pyrobox -d .` to launch the server in current directory (where the file is)
        * `pyrobox -d "D:\Server\Public folder\"`  (Use Double-Quotation while directory has space)
        * `pyrobox -d "D:/Server/Public folder"` (Forward or backward slash really doesn't matter, unless your terminal thinks otherwise)
1. To change port number
    * (i) just edit the code for permanent change  (see `config` class at top)
    * (ii) or add the port number at the end of the command line arg
        * `pyrobox 45678` # will run on port 45678
        * `pyrobox -d . 45678` # will run on port 45678 in current directory

1. To specify alternate bind address
    * Add bind add `-bind {address}` # ie: `-bind 127.0.0.2` or `-bind 127.0.0.99`

1. To change upload password
    * (i) or add `-k` or `--password` command line argument when launching the program
        * `pyrobox -k "my new password"` to launch the server with new password
        * `pyrobox -k ""` to launch the server without password
        * `pyrobox` to launch the server with default password (SECret)
    * (ii) just edit the code for permanent change  (see `config` class at top)

1. Optional configurations

usage: `pyrobox [--password PASSWORD] [--no-upload] [--no-zip] [--no-update] [--no-delete] [--no-download] [--read-only] [--view-only] [--bind ADDRESS] [--directory DIRECTORY] [--version] [-h] [port]`

## Advanced Account System

> ### You must give a `--name [Name]` and `--admin-id [USER Name]`, `--admin-pass [PASSWORD]` to create an admin account. If guest not allowed `--no-guest-allowed` User must login to access the server. You can also disable signing up `--no-signup` (Only admin can add user from admin page). Admin can also update user permission from admin page.

  | Flags/Arg `value`    | Description |
  | -------------------- | ------------|
  |--name `NAME`, -n `NAME` | Name of the user (default: None)|
  |--admin-id `ADMIN_ID`, -aid `ADMIN_ID` | Admin ID (default: None)|
  |--admin-pass `ADMIN_PASS`, -ak `ADMIN_PASS` | Admin Password (default: None)|
  |--no-signup, -ns      | Disable Signing up (Only admin can add user from admin page)(default: False)|
  |--no-guest-allowed, -ng | Disable Guest Access (default: False)|

## Account Example

  1. `pyrobox -n "My Server1" -aid "admin" -ak "admin123" -k "Guest_pass"` # will allow anyone to access the server, but they must use `Guest_pass` to upload files
  1. `pyrobox -n "My Server2" -aid "admin" -ak "admin123" -ng` # If someone wants to access the server they must sign up via signup page first. No guest allowed
  1. `pyrobox -n "My Server3" -aid "admin" -ak "admin123" -ng -ns` # Only admin can access the server. No guest allowed, no signup allowed. Admin can add user from admin page


## Clone Directory

  1. Make a python file with the following code
  ``` python
  from pyrobox import clone
  clone.main()
  ```
  1. Run the file. Follow the instructions.
  1. For advanced use, check the source code of `clone.py` in the `pyrobox` module.

* https://github.com/RaSan147/pyrobox/issues/34 Copy stream URL for videos to play with any video player
* https://github.com/RaSan147/pyrobox/issues/36 Add side bar to do something ü§î
* check output ip and port accuracy on multiple os
* https://github.com/RaSan147/pyrobox/issues/37 Backup code if Reload causes unhandled issue and can't be accessed
* Add more flags to disable specific features

  <summary>Using WSL, "PIP not found"</summary>

  > Run this to install `pip3` and add `pip` to path

  ``` bash
  sudo apt -y purge python3-pip
  sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip
  sudo apt -y install python3-pip
  pip3 install --upgrade pip
  echo "export PATH=\"${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH\"" >>"${HOME}"/.bashrc

  <summary>Deleted (Move to Recycle), But WHERE ARE THEY?? [on LINUX & WSL]</summary>

  > Actually the feature is working fine, unfortunately NO-GUI mode linux and WSL don't recycle bin, so you can't find it!
  > And to make things worse, **you need to manually clear the recyle bin** from `~/.local/share/Trash`
  > **SO I'D RECOMMAND USING DELETE PARMANENTLY**
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Running on WINDOWS, but can't access with other device [FIREWALL]</summary>

  > You probably have **FireWall ON** and not configured.
  > For your safety, I'd recommend you to allow Python on private network and run the server when your network is Private.
  > IN SHORT: ALLOW PYTHON ON FIREWALL, RUN THE SERVER

  > *note: allowed on private but using public network on firewall will cause similar issue, you gotta make both same or allow python both on public and private*
